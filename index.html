    <h1>Small Chocolates </h1>
  <p>
  Chocolate is a food made from the seeds of a cacao bean. It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, ice cream. and Easter eggs. It can be a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. The taste of chocolate is often described as sweet because chocolate makers usually add a lot of sugar and milk for taste. This means that chocolate can be bad for your teeth and health. It is best to eat chocolate in moderation.</p>

            <p>Candy, also called sweets or lollies, is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be candied.

Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a dessert course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals. Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another. </p>

  <h1>Big Chocolates</h1>
<p>
  In June 1905 in England, Cadbury made its first Dairy Milk bar, with a higher proportion of milk than previous chocolate bars, and it became the company's best-selling product by 1914. George Cadbury Junior, responsible for the development of the bar, has said "All sorts of names were suggested: Highland Milk, Jersey and Dairy Maid. But when a customer’s daughter suggested Dairy Milk, the name stuck."[3] Fruit and Nut was introduced as part of the Dairy Milk line in 1926, soon followed by Whole Nut in 1933. By this point, Cadbury's was the brand leader in the United Kingdom.[4] In 1928, Cadbury's introduced the "glass and a half" slogan to accompany the Dairy Milk bar, to advertise the bar's higher milk content.[5]

In September 2012, Cadbury made the decision to change the shape of the bar chunks to a more circular shape in order to reduce the weight. The bar had not seen such a significant change in shape for since 1905.

Since 2007 Cadbury had a trademark in the United Kingdom for the distinctive purple colour (Pantone 2865C) of its chocolate bar wrappers,[6] originally introduced in 1914 as a tribute to Queen Victoria.[7] In October 2013, however, an appeal by Nestlé succeeded in overturning that court ruling.[8]

In July 2018, Cadbury announced it would launch a new Dairy Milk version with 30% less sugar. The chief nutritionist of Public Health England, Dr Alison Tedstone said she was "pleased that Mondelez is the latest ... name" to offer "healthier" products.[9]
